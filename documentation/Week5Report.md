# Week 5 Report

Unfortunately, due to a busy schedule this week, I was unable to get much done regarding my project. Apart from doing the required peer review, the only things I did were improve code quality and testing (although testing update was not pushed yet, read below).

The first thing I did was improve the quality of my code. I did this using a built-in feature of InteliJ IDEA, which allows you to inspect the code in your project and gives warnings regarding thiings such as: unused variables, typos, unused methods, etc. Using this feature allowed me to improve the quality of my code drastically.

Another thing I started to do was implement more testing for the AI. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I was unable to finish these tests and thus did not push them in yet for this week's deadline.

Next week, I plan on basically finishing my project by doing the following things:
* Implement more comments/Javadoc to make my code more user-friendly
* Finish implementing the tests I started working on this week
* Testing around with the minimax algorithm to see if it works better at other depths
* Create testing document, and make sure testing coverage is at 100%

Once all these things have been completed, my project should be finished.

Total time spent on the project this week: 3 hours

Total time spent on the project in total: 31 hours
