# Week 6 Report

This week, I was able to finish my project. The first thing I did was finish my tests, and add a few more as well. These tests helped me understand how my AI thinks, as well as get an understanding for the time it takes for the AI to calculate a move at certain depths, thus allowing me to choose a suitable and finalized depth for the bot. I decided to choose depth 8, since it was still extremely fast to calculate, but still very strong in calculating the best moves. With depth 8, I am only able to beat the bot 1/10 times on average. At depth 10, the bot becomes even smarter, but at this depth, you will start noticing delays when you play the game, so I decided against using it to make the user experience the best it can be.

I also implemented JavaDoc and added more comments this week, so that my code would be fully readable and understandable. I also had to create two new documents this week for documentation: implementation document and testing document. These documents were both very straight-forward.

Overall, I enjoyed making this project, as I feel I learned a lot, and I also had a lot of fun trying to improve my AI as best I could. It has been a great time.
