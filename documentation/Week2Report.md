# Week 2 Report

This week, I continued to work on the functionality of my project. Since I basically finished the core functionality last week regarding the UI, this week I made sure that there were no more bugs and that everything worked cleanly. I was able to do this with little to no issues, so now, the UI aspect of my project is done.

I set up test files for the project, under the testing directory. I assume that the files regarding the UI do not need to be testing, so there are only three files I need to do tests for. I added the junit library as a dependency to the project, so next week, I can begin conducting tests to make sure everything works accordingly in my code. I also added the pitest library which is used for testing coverage.

I did not start implementing the minimax AI algorithm yet this week. However, I did some research on it, so now I know what needs to be done in order to implement it. Next week, I plan on starting the AI aspect of this project.

This week, I continued to learn about JFrame implementations. Everything else I did this week was done using prior knowledge on topics such as junit. 

Total time spent on the project this week: 6 hours

Total time spent on the project in total: 14 hours
