# Week 1 Report

For my project topic, I decided that I will make a Connect 4 UI and implement an AI as the player's opponent.

During this week, I implemented the UI and got it to work (the only current error that I can find is that when the user chooses to be player 2, the first move made by the AI is not shown until the user chooses a move. This will be fixed by week 2).

As of now, there is no AI involved in the move choice by the bot. I set it up so that it simply chooses a random column to place their piece. Next week, I plan on researching into the minimax algorithm and slowly implementing it into my project.

Another thing I plan on doing next week is making the code more organized and readable. Right now, there are many functions that do not serve a purpose, and there are also some components to the project that could be implemented better.

This week, I learned about a lot of JFrame implementations. Although I have used it in the past, there were some components that I have used thus far in the project that I have never used before.

Total time spent this week on the project: 8 hours
